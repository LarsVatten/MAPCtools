This is the repository containing the source code, documentation and metadata for the R package $\texttt{MAPCtools}$, a package for analyzing age-period-cohort data. 
The package provides functions for estimating Bayesian APC models using INLA. 

The package was developed during my Master's thesis in the 30 credit course TMA4900 - Industrial Mathematics, Master's Thesis.
